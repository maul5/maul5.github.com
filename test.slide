The Go Mobile project is experimental. Use this at your own risk.

While we are working hard to improve it, neither Google nor the Go
team can provide end-user support.

* Background

Mobile support was frequently requested

Some users built their own Go binaries for Android with cgo + external linking through NDK tool chains

Some Android Apps used Go even before Go 1.4

Goal: Bring Go to Mobile Platforms

Why?

- Use Go to program a complete system (server/client)
- Write a single cross-platform Go library
- Bring a simple language and development tooling to mobile
